# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview

The project focus was to use an unsupervised machine learning model to produce a report  that shows which cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for an investment.

## Process Overview

The process included three major steps: 

1. *Processging the Data*: the data was processed using Pandas. 

2. *PCA*: data dimensions were reduced using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm.

3. *Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means*: K-means algorithm was used to predict the K clusters for the cryptocurrenciesâ€™ data.
